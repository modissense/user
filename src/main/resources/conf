# this is a configuration file used to set the database parameters to the modissense platform
# the parameters name is pretty much self-explicable.

# IMPORTANT: if an IPv6 address is set for DATABASE_HOST instead of a host name,
# brackets should be placed
# e.g.
#	DATABASE_HOST	[ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff]
# IPv4 and hostnames can be put without brackets

# the keys (parameters name) are separated from their values with a tab (\t) character. You may use as many tabs as you
# want for alignments reasons but you MUST NOT replace the tab with a set of spaces

# Finally, changing the predefined parameter names is never a good idea. The parameters names is set this way for a reason ;)
